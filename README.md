# Big_Basket_Cart_Prediction


Project Overview:
The Big Basket cart prediction machine learning model is designed to predict the items that a customer is likely to add to their cart based on their previous order history. The model is built using association-based learning algorithm Apriori algorithm to generate frequent itemsets and association rules from the transaction data. The model is then tested and validated using a holdout set or cross-validation to evaluate its accuracy and performance.

Project Objectives:

To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the items that a customer is likely to add to their cart.
To use association-based learning algorithm Apriori algorithm to generate frequent itemsets and association rules from the transaction data.
To test and validate the model using a holdout set or cross-validation to evaluate its accuracy and performance.
To deploy the model in a production environment


Project Methodology:

1. Data collection: Collect data from the Big Basket website or API. The data should include customer order history.
2. Data preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, such as removing duplicates and missing values, and transform the data into a transaction format suitable for Apriori algorithm.
3. Association rule mining: Use the Apriori algorithm to generate frequent itemsets and association rules from the transaction data.
4. Rule filtering: Filter the association rules based on minimum support and minimum confidence thresholds.
5. Rule evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the association rules using measures such as lift and conviction.
6. Model building: Build a machine learning model using the association rules as input features and the target variable as the prediction of the items that will be added to the cart.
7. Model testing and validation: Test and validate the model using a holdout set or cross-validation to evaluate its accuracy and performance.
8. Model deployment: Deploy the model in a production environment 

Outcomes:

A machine learning model that accurately predicts the items that a customer is likely to add to their cart.
A set of association rules that can be used to understand the relationships between items in the transaction data.
Improved customer experience by suggesting the most relevant items to add to their cart.
Increased sales revenue by encouraging customers to add more items to their cart.


Conclusion:


The Big Basket cart prediction machine learning model using association-based learning algorithm Apriori algorithm is a valuable tool for e-commerce companies looking to improve their customer experience and increase their sales revenue. By predicting the items that a customer is likely to add to their cart, the model can suggest the most relevant items to customers, leading to higher sales and improved customer satisfaction.
